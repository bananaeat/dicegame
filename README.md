# dicegame
A simple combat game prototype that involves strategy and RNG. Using Golang as back-end, JQuery and Bootstrap as front-end.

This game is (kind-of) extendable, if you want to add new enemies, weapons or armors you only need to add new classes in respective files.
The main effort here is the arts of the monsters and equipments, and most importantly - the dices. (And this is where I am not good at)
